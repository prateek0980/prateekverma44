
Introduction of DBMS (Database Management System) â€“ Set -1 

A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner. It allows users to create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage the security and access controls for that database.

DBMS provides an environment to store and retrieve the data in coinvent and efficient manner.

# Key Features of DBMS


1- Data modeling: A DBMS provides tools for creating and modifying data models, which define the structure and relationships of the data in a database.

2- Data storage and retrieval: A DBMS is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database, and can provide various methods for searching and querying the data.

3-Concurrency control: A DBMS provides mechanisms for controlling concurrent access to the database, to ensure that multiple users can access the data without conflicting with each other.

4-Data integrity and security: A DBMS provides tools for enforcing data integrity and security constraints, such as constraints on the values of data and access controls that restrict who can access the data.

5-Backup and recovery: A DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up and recovering the data in the event of a system failure.

6-DBMS can be classified into two types: Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and Non-Relational Database Management System (NoSQL or Non-SQL)

7-RDBMS: Data is organized in the form of tables and each table has a set of rows and columns. The data are related to each other through primary and foreign keys.



Advantages of DBMS

1-Data organization: A DBMS allows for the organization and storage of data in a structured manner, making it easy to retrieve and query the data as needed.

2-Data integrity: A DBMS provides mechanisms for enforcing data integrity constraints, such as constraints on the values of data and access controls that restrict who can access the data.

3-Concurrent access: A DBMS provides mechanisms for controlling concurrent access to the database, to ensure that multiple users can access the data without conflicting with each other.

4-Data security: A DBMS provides tools for managing the security of the data, such as controlling access to the data and encrypting sensitive data.

5-Backup and recovery: A DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up and recovering the data in the event of a system failure.

6-Data sharing: A DBMS allows multiple users to access and share the same data, which can be useful in a collaborative work environment.


Disadvantages of DBMS
Complexity: DBMS can be complex to set up and maintain, requiring specialized knowledge and skills.

Performance overhead: The use of a DBMS can add overhead to the performance of an application, especially in cases where high levels of concurrency are required.

Scalability: The use of a DBMS can limit the scalability of an application, since it requires the use of locking and other synchronization mechanisms to ensure data consistency.

Cost: The cost of purchasing, maintaining and upgrading a DBMS can be high, especially for large or complex systems.




Several Types of DBMS

Relational DBMS (RDBMS): An RDBMS stores data in tables with rows and columns, and uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to manipulate the data.

Object-Oriented DBMS (OODBMS): An OODBMS stores data as objects, which can be manipulated using object-oriented programming languages.

NoSQL DBMS: A NoSQL DBMS stores data in non-relational data structures, such as key-value pairs, document-based models, or graph mod








Data stored is in table format    	                                 Data stored is in the file format
Multiple data elements are accessible together  	                Individual access of data elements
Data in the form of a table are linked together	                           No connection between data
Normalisation is not achievable	                                           There is normalisation
Support distributed database	                                         No support for distributed database
Data is stored in a large amount                                         	Data stored is a small quantity
Here, redundancy of data is reduced with the help of key and                                        data redundancy is common

RDBMS supports multiple users	                                                DBMS supports a single user
It features multiple layers of security while handling data      	There is only low security while handling data
The software and hardware requirements are higher	                The software and hardware requirements are low
